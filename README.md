Hi! I'm Peppe ðŸ‘½ and this is my first release ðŸ”¥ , it's meant to Create ðŸ†• , Upload ðŸ“¤ , Send ðŸ“§ and Check âœ… Tokens for such as User Registration validation or whatever! Feel free to send suggestions or issues! This is Still W.I.P.

Download the .zip files and put into the website folder

# Requirements
 PHPMailer /PHPMailer



## Database

The necessary connections are inside the file: **database.php** , make sure to edit with your credentials
Also there is a ***.sql*** file into the folder ***/Database Files Example*** with the minimum required fields and tables to make the token system works

## Usage

 1. Make sure to Include **token.php** file into your php pages with:
 `include 'token.php';`
 
 2. **TokenValidate.php** page get's the token variable and email variable with a GET request and handle those 

## function  generate_token(tokenlenght)

 This function generates a token with the given lenght and returns the value
 ***Insert a minimum of 5 for lenght for safety reason***
## function  upload_token(token,email)
This function upload the token and email variables into the database 
## function  mail_token(token,email)
Sends an email to the user email with the generated token url - **maybe this still doesn't work properly**
## function  validate_token(token,email)
The most important function, checks if the token is expired (**time limit is 24hours**) and if it's not it validate the user and delete the users token.
